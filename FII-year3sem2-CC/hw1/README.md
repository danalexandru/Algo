### Install guide

To run server: double-click `open_server.bat` or run in `cmd.exe` the command `npm start`
To install extension:
+ navigate to `chrome://extensions/`
+ check `developer mode`
+ click `load unpacked extension` and select the folder `chrome_ext/`
+ see the new extension with the `D` icon and click

Don't forget to run the server before opening the extension (will automate with some NPAPI alternative soon).
