# Algo
a bit of everything
  
  
This repo is for **algorithms**, **faculty code**, or generally for **side projects** that don't need yet a dedicated repo.
  
### Contents
  
Here are 3 types of work:
  - standalone folders - for now, only `arduino/` stuff
  - code folders - interesting aspects, starter code ... - `code-*/`
  - faculty code folders - implemented algorithms, homeworks - `FII-*/`

*Obs*: Everything else will be put in `misc/` folder (at least while there is no need for a dedicated folder)
